                <p>In the year 2148 CE the human race discovered the ruins of an ancient race known as the Protheans on Mars. After discovering these ruins, humanity learned the secrets of Mass Effect Physics and something called Element Zero, these two things combined gave humans the ability to discover faster than light travel. The human race also discovered the Mass Relay Network which permitted them instantaneous passage across thousands of light years and opened up the whole galaxy for discovery. This was when humanity started its journey among the stars and established its presence in the universe.</p>
